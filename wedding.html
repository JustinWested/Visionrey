                Meet Chloe and Max, two free-spirited lovebirds who celebrated their union with an epic bash at the stunning Barn on Bridge. The venue was decked out in bohemian d√©cor, and guests danced under the stars to the beat of live music. Chloe dazzled in a sleek and modern gown, and Max looked dapper in his stylish suit. Together, they exuded effortless cool and radiated joy throughout their big day. Capturing their love story was an absolute dream, and I feel so grateful to have been a part of their unforgettable wedding.

                Introducing Sarah and Jack, two adventurous souls who tied the knot at the charming and rustic Montsalvat. Their wedding was a whimsical affair, complete with flower crowns, dreamcatchers, and a delicious feast that was enjoyed by all. The festivities spilled over into the next day, where guests continued to celebrate and create memories that will last a lifetime. Sarah looked stunning in a boho-inspired gown, and Jack was the picture of handsome in his tailored suit. I loved capturing their playful, carefree spirit, and their love for each other was truly infectious.

                Say hello to Emily and James, two modern lovebirds who celebrated their love in the heart of the city. We captured their engagement session at the iconic Flinders Street Station, where they posed against the gritty, urban backdrop of Melbourne. For their wedding, we headed to the breathtaking Yarra Valley, where the picturesque vineyards and rolling hills provided the perfect setting for their elegant and sophisticated affair. Emily was radiant in her classic, lace gown, and James was suave and stylish in his tuxedo. Their love was palpable, and I was honored to document their love story in such a stunning location.
